## What I learned

This project helped me understand more about vanilla JavaScript since it was very interactive. 

I tried to code along and there were times that I had to figure out on my own how certain things functioned.

This project not only helped me understand more about the previous projects, but this will definitely help me a lot with the coming up projects.
